## 📌 Project Description

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset sourced from Kaggle.  
The primary goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights behind employee attrition in a corporate setting.

By leveraging powerful Python libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, we investigate key features such as:
- Work-life balance
- Environment satisfaction
- Job role and job level
- Overtime effect
- Monthly income and more
